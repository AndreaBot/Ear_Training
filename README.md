# Ear_Training
My second project

Having learnt about how to play audio files within an app in my previous project, I then got the idea to work on an ear training app.
The idea is to have a button playing a random audio file (a single note) and let the user guess what note was played by tapping the correspondent note button.

Skills and knowledge acquired:

1) Passing data between diferent view controllers
2) Implementation of a timer
3) if/else statements
4) Functions
5) Passing data between functions (inout)
6) Controlling the state (enable/disable) of different buttons to respond to user interaction and communicate that through the UI
7) Implementing counters and their behavious to then be shown as a final result to the user
8) Tweaking the code within different View Controllers to build separate game modes.
