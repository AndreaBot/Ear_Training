Ear Training is my second project which I built a couple of weeks after the DnD app.
Building on top of the skills I gained on that previous one I decided to build something a bit more complex where the audio files played a bigger part.

In this app a button plays a single note and is up to the user to guess what note was played by tapping the correspondent note button.
A gameover message then shows how many notes were correctly identified and how many mistakes were made.

To then complete the app I created four different game modes:
- Pratice Mode:
  Here the player can take as much time as necessary and keep playing for as long as he/she wants
- Easy Mode:
  In this mode the player has 30 seconds to guess as many notes as possible. The button to repeat the sound is enabled.
- Hard Mode:
  Same as easy mode but the time is limited to 10 seconds
- Survival Mode:
  The ultimate test: in this game mode each correct guess adds 2 seconds to the time but each wrong guess takes 2 seconds away instead. The button to repeat the sound is not available.

Skills and knowledge acquired:

- Passing data between diferent view controllers
- Implementation of a timer
- if/else statements
- Functions
- Controlling the state (enable/disable) of different buttons to respond to user interaction and communicate that through the UI
- Implementing counters and their behavious to then be shown as a final result to the user
- Tweaking the code within different View Controllers to build separate game modes.
